# How to contribute

The book has been divided into sections for easy addition and removal of questions

I have left `chapter 8` empty (changing names is boring)

You might wanna read [mdbook guide](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/) before contributing

All the questions are in the following format `src/chapterX/questions.md`

All your contributions will be considered under [MIT LICENSE](LICENSE)

Finally execute `mdbook build` after adding questions (provide one solution in [playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)) and try not 
include questions that convey the same concept
